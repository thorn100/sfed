.grid-col + .grid-col { margin-left: 2.6%; }

another way to layout the community & poll?
  - equal columns?
  - ended up adding negative margin-left

Alternative for text trunication that is cross browser compatibile?
  - currently deleted some words to allow correct display across browsers.

/** TODO **/
Convert images to sprites
Icon hover states
JavaScript for carousel (gifts that do)
Clean CSS
Landing page? to link to styleguide and index?

/** NOTES **/
Consolidating all section headings (Featured, Search, Recent, Categories, Community, Store, Featured Category Articles) to 14px. In the comp all sections use this but Search which uses 12px.
Consolidating h3 heading styles. Comp uses four different sizes (18, 16, 14, 12). Deciding to eliminate 18px size.
	- created new class "hdg-3-alt3" for 18px size.
